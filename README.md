# Portfolio

This is a repo for my portfolio site.

[Here's a link to the live site.](https://portfolio-three-ruby.vercel.app/)

The site was built using React.js as the main framework, and uses basic CSS for styling. 

## About Page

The About Page has two sections: About Me, and Contact. The About Me section details a little bit about my interests as an engineer and as a person, and the Contact section gives links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, and email. It also features a basic email contact form that can be used to send messages from the site itself.

## Projects Page

The projects page offers a basic paginated view of three of my main projects working with Thinkful. Each view shows a screenshot of the application, a description of what the app does, as well as a list of tecnologies used in the stack. It also gives a link to the live application.
